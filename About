# web_scraping

I am going to disscuss about the importance or need of this repository.

As the Repository names says, here you will find all my web-scraping projects.

# Andhra_data
-Throught this folder you will find some messey(unwanted) files please ignore those files.
-I just saved my work, for future refernces.
-If you want final submission the goto final_submission folder and you will find my code there.
-so, i  have done this project as per request from one of my brother who is working in 'NGO'(Non- Government Organisation) , Andhra Pradesh.Who needs some data of 'prohited properties' in chittor district.
He needs thousands of survey numbers (may be lakhs), so it is not possible to get data manually.
So, I automated the whole process through python selenium.
Which now automatically fetch data, and stores data in text file, and then i stored in '.csv' file using pandas.
After some preprocessing( because the data is too clumpsy), I finally done with this project.
****As of me Project means solving real world/human problems****
