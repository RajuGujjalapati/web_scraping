# web_scraping

I am going to disscuss about the importance or need of this repository.

As the Repository names says, here you will find all my web-scraping projects.

# Andhra_data
Throught this folder you will find some messey(unwanted) files please ignore those files.
I just saved my work, for future refernces.
If you want final submission the goto final_submission folder and you will find my code there.
so, i  have done this project as per request from one of my brother who is working in 'NGO'(Non- Government Organisation) , Andhra Pradesh.Who needs some data of 'prohited properties' in chittor district.
He needs thousands of survey numbers (may be lakhs), so it is not possible to get data manually.
So, I automated the whole process through python selenium.
Which now automatically fetches data, and stores data in text file, and then i stored in '.csv' file using pandas.
After some preprocessing( because the data is too clumpsy), I finally done! with this project.
****For me Project means solving real world/human problems****

# youtube_playlists

- Due to covid, I was learning django and some other programming languages.
-I found difficult while watching videos, due to internet connectivity.
-So, I have the plans and timetable to learn, so i need to download manually every video.
Yes, that is completelty fine if i am 'OK' with one video, what if i need a playlists consist of 30-100 videos.
It is not possible every time to give new video link to download right.
so, i just wanted to build a program which takes playlist link and download every video.
You will find this code in 'selenium_youtbe_playlists_downld.py' file.
